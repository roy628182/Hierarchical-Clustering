# Hierarchical-Clustering
A repository for implementing and exploring Hierarchical Clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm.

- Implementations of Hierarchical Clustering in Python using Scikit-learn and NumPy
- Examples of using Hierarchical Clustering for image segmentation, customer segmentation, and gene expression analysis
- Code for visualizing dendrograms using matplotlib and seaborn
- Comparison of Hierarchical Clustering with other clustering algorithms, such as K-Means Clustering and DBSCAN

This repository includes a Python implementation of Hierarchical Clustering using Scikit-learn and NumPy. The implementation includes:

- A function for computing the distance matrix
- A function for building the dendrogram
- A function for cutting the dendrogram to obtain clusters
